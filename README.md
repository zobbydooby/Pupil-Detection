A test of combination haar cascade, hough circle detection and colour detection in an attempt to detect pupil position (theoretical development step 1).

Areas of the right eye only are enlarged and areas of interest (in this case, darkest area of schlea, lightest area of schlea and iris/pupil) highlighted to allow indication of success of method.
